# Spotify Music Recommender

Welcome to the Spotify Music Recommender project! This project utilizes Spotify's rich dataset to build a music recommendation system. Using data from the Million Playlist Dataset (MPD), this system suggests songs based on user preferences and listening habits.

## Project Structure

- `data_processing.ipynb`: Notebook for preprocessing and cleaning the Spotify dataset.
- `model_training.ipynb`: Notebook for training the recommendation models.
- `app.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the application of the recommender system.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and analyze Spotify's dataset to understand music trends and user preferences.
- **Recommendation System**: Utilize machine learning techniques to recommend songs to users.
- **Interactive Interface**: An interactive Jupyter Notebook to showcase the recommendation system in action.

## Setup and Installation
